  Thank you for installing Adblock Plus. This extension can
  eliminate 99&#x25; of the advertisements you see on the web. However,
  effective ad filtering requires you to define a good set of
  filters. You can do it yourself, or you can simply subscribe
  to filter lists others maintain for you. It will still be possible
  to add your own filters or deactivate/remove subscriptions
  whenever necessary.

  You can choose one subscription from the
  list of recommended subscriptions below (more subscriptions can be
  added in Adblock Plus Preferences later though usually this is not
  necessary):

  Note: A filter list is typically most effective when applied
  to web sites from the region this filter list was created for.

  Adblock Plus has detected that Adblock or an old version of Adblock Plus is
  installed. Running both Adblock and Adblock Plus in parallel can cause
  problems and should be avoided. It is recommended that you uninstall Adblock now.

  It seems that you use Filterset.G. This filter list has been barely
  maintained in the last few years and is a common cause of problems with web
  sites. It is recommended that you uninstall Filterset.G now.
